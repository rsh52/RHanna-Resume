# Richard Hanna's Resume
 
 Welcome to my resume. I give much of the credit for this to Nick Strayer's work, please check out his [repo](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv) as well as the authors of the `pagedown` and `rmarkdown` packages. 
 
 Please feel free to use this as you see fit for your own resume as the author intended. 
 
 Please feel free to reach out to me with any inquiries, comments, or questions. Thank you!
